  Create a well-formed git commit from current changes using session history for
  rationale and summary; use when asked to commit, prepare a commit message, or
  finalize staged work.

# Commit

## Goals

- Produce a commit that reflects the actual code changes and the session
  context.
- Follow common git conventions.
- Include both summary and rationale in the body.

## Inputs

- Codex session history for intent and rationale.
- `git status`, `git diff`, and `git diff --staged` for actual changes.
- Repo-specific commit conventions if documented.

## Steps

1. Read session history to identify scope, intent, and rationale.
2. Inspect the working tree and staged changes.
3. Stage intended changes after confirming scope.
4. Sanity-check newly added files; if anything looks random or likely ignored,
   flag it before committing.
5. If staging is incomplete or includes unrelated files, fix the index or ask
   for confirmation.
6. Choose a conventional type and optional scope that match the change.
7. Write a subject line in imperative mood, <= 72 characters, no trailing
   period.
8. Write a body that includes:
   - Summary of key changes.
   - Rationale and trade-offs.
   - Tests or validation run, or an explicit note if not run.
9. Append a `Co-authored-by` trailer for Codex using
   `Codex <codex@openai.com>` unless instructed otherwise.
10. Wrap body lines at 72 characters.
11. Create the commit message with a here-doc or temp file and use
    `git commit -F <file>` so newlines are literal.
12. Commit only when the message matches the staged changes.

## Template

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

Summary:
- <what changed>
- <what changed>

Rationale:
- <why>
- <why>

Tests:
- <command or "not run (reason)">

Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@openai.com>
